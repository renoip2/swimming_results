# swimming_results
Nowadays swimming is becoming more and more popular. The most famous Olympic champion is also swimmer Michael Phelps. However, there is stereotype that only tall athletes can become Olympic champion in swimming.
That is why the goal of this work is to create portrait of an average swimmer athlete.
To achieve the goal of this work, the following tasks were set:
1. Cleaning and preparing data.
2. Finding correlation between year of Olympic games and Height(Weight).
3. Finding correlation between distance and Height(Weight).
To achieve the objectives and goals in this work, we use the pandas library for working with tabular data. In addition, we will use numpy library for working with arrays and mathematic computations and matplotlib for plotting graphs. In this work we will use well-know Olimpic Dataset and create new dataset with results from official Olimpic site.
Olympic dataset you can get from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results
